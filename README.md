# Dice Game Project

This project aims to create a browser-based dice game with improved functionality and user experience. It is a collaborative effort between [Khutso](https://github.com/IvanKhutso) and [Nomthandazo](https://github.com/Nomthy31).

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a dynamic browser-based dice game that allows two or more players to take turns rolling dice. The game will feature clear rules, interactive user interface, and dynamic updates of the game state on the webpage.

## Features

- **Game Rules & Mechanics**: Define clear rules and mechanics for the game including the number of dice rolled, turn rotation, win conditions, and special rules.

- **User Interactions**: Support user interactions through buttons ('Roll Dice', 'New Game', 'Hold') to trigger corresponding game mechanics.

- **DOM Manipulation**: The game state will be clearly displayed on the webpage with dynamic updates in response to the gameâ€™s progress.

- **Game State Management**: Efficiently manage and update the game state in JavaScript code, including tracking player scores, turn rotation, and game outcome.

- **Improved Design**: Identify and implement enhancements to the existing design for better gameplay mechanics, UI/UX, or additional features.

- **Error Handling**: Implement suitable error handling for scenarios like invalid input or game state.
